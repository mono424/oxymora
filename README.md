**HOW TO INSTALL**

Very easy to install. Just copy all Oxymora
files to your Web-Root or a Subfolder.

Now access Oxymora over a Browser. Oxymora
will automatically redirect your to its
own setup.

Just follow the Setup. You can either choose
to restore it from a Backup or setup it up
from the scratch.

If you restore a Backup, make sure you have
a big enough "memory_limit", "post_max_size"
and "upload_max_filesize" set in your
"php.ini". There is a "".htacces"
in "setup"-folder where you can uncomment
the 3 commented lines what can be the easy
fix.

Thank you for choosing Oxymora :)
